# Use the Email Script Token found at the program or folder-level in Marketing Activities
# Logic is a big if-then statement to display dynamic content on emails
# Bring tokens in from script panel and remove {} brackets from code
# Be sure to check box of any field used in the token code (for access)

# Primary Query Operators:
#if – Starts an "If" statement. Works just like excel to check if a record matches your criteria.
#elseif – Allows for multiple #if statements if the record does not qualify for your first set of criteria. 
#if recordtype equals "1", do this thing -> #elseif recordtype equals "2", do this other thing, etc.
#else as default choice for records that do not match any of your if statement criteria.
#end to close the script.  If you forget #end, your email will likely fail to approve or send.


# Logic Rules:
# AND: &&
# OR: ||
# Equals: $lead.fieldName.equals("value")
#Does Not Equal: !$lead.fieldName.equals("value")
#Contains: $lead.FieldName.contains("value")
#Check if the Field Is Empty: $lead.FieldName.isEmpty()
#Check if the Field is Not Empty: !$lead.FieldName.isEmpty()
# Set variables: #set($variablename = "value")


# Sample Email Script for Salutation

##check if the lead is male
#if(${lead.MarketoSocialGender} == "Male")
	##if the lead is male, use the salutation 'Mr.'
	#set($greeting = "Dear Mr. ${lead.LastName},")
##check is the lead is female
#elseif(${lead.MarketoSocialGender} == "Female")
	##if female, use the salutation 'Ms.'
	#set($greeting = "Dear Ms. ${lead.LastName},")
#else
	##otherwise, use the first name
	#set($greeting = "Dear ${lead.FirstName},")
#end
##print the greeting and some content
${greeting}
